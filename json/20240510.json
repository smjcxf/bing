Misool is an island of almost 800 square miles within the Raja Ampat archipelago in Indonesia. The archipelago comprises four main islands, including Misool, Waigeo, Batanta, and Salawati. Here, the waves caress the powder-white sands, while a kaleidoscope of marine life swims beneath the surface. Raja Ampat is part of the Coral Triangle, a remote ocean wilderness that is home to hundreds of species of reef-building corals alongside marine turtles, sharks, whales, dugongs, dolphins, and thousands of species of reef fish. The archipelago is dotted with Marine Protected Areas, of which Misool is the largest, and includes nesting beaches for green and hawksbill turtles. Surrounded by a 'no-take zone' with fishing and hunting activities banned and a shark and manta ray sanctuary, Misool offers hope for the future of our oceans.","date":"May 10, 2024","bsTitle":"The islands are calling!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240510_MisoolRajaAmpat%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4bb04f58d448e9dabd152d900494bb41","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
