M. Nunes/Getty Images","desc":"The longest river in Namibia—the Fish River—has carved out Africa's largest canyon over millions of years. Winding through weathered layers of gneiss and dolomite rocks, the Fish River Canyon is around 100 miles long and about 1,800 feet deep. Its hiking trail stretches for more than 50 miles, attracting adventure seekers and ultramarathon runners. Moreover, with Hartmann's mountain zebras, klipspringers, and eastern rock elephant shrews, the canyon is teeming with creatures big and small. So, whether you are there for hiking, trekking, camping, or just soaking in the scenery, one thing's for sure: Fish River Canyon is a catch you won't soon forget.","date":"May 13, 2024","bsTitle":"Africa’s grandest canyon","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240513_NamibiaCanyon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7c246cd73671172349d033f43a796ca2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
